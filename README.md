# Kinet

Kinet is a high-performance entity tracking engine designed to efficiently identify and track entities across multiple snapshots. By continuously calculating the distances between these snapshots, Kinet determines which entities are the same, enabling precise tracking and analysis.

## Use Cases

1. **Path Tracking**: Monitor and analyze the movement patterns of entities over time.
2. **Delay Computation**: Measure and optimize delays in entity interactions and processes.
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Assess the performance of systems and applications by tracking entity behavior.
4. **Real-Time World Digitalization**: Create dynamic digital representations of the physical world by tracking entities in real-time.
